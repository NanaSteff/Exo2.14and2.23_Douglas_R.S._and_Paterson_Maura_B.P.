**2.14**
(a) Prove that det $A\equiv\pm 1(\mod 26)$ if $A$ is a matrix over $\mathbb{Z}$ 26 such that
$A=A^{-1}$.


(b) Use the formula given in Corollary 2.4 to determine the number of involutory keys in the Hill Cipher (over $\mathbb{Z}_{26}$) in the case $m=2$.



**2.23**
Suppose we are told that the plaintext

```
breathtaking
```
yields the ciphertext
```
RUPOTENTOIFV
```

where the Hill Cipher is used (but m is not specified). Determine the encryption matrix.
